An importer to MySQL of Stack Exchange XML data files.

Requirements:

  - Python 2.7(ish)
  - SQLAlchemy Python Library
  - MySQLdb Python Library
  - MySQL Client Libraries
  - MySQL 5.6 (probably lower, but not tested)
  - Stack Overflow data (http://blog.stackexchange.com/category/cc-wiki-dump/)

  Purportedly MariaDB works as well, but that is also untested.

Usage:

  First, create a database to store the information, and create the tables
  defined in stackexchange-schema.sql.

  To import one of the files from the data dump, pass it to the script along
  with a URI describing the database to populate. To import the Comments.xml
  file to a database named 'se_data' on host 'dbhost' as user 'se_user' with
  password 'se_pass,' you would use the command:

  ./separser.py Comments.xml mysql://se_user:se_pass@dbhost/se_data?charset=utf8

  The last bit about the charset is super important. Leaving it off will lead to
  pain.
